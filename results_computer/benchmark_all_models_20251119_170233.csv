When you drop something, like a pen or ball, Earth's gravity is constantly pulling on it. That's why the pen falls down instead of floating up - gravity is stronger than any force pushing it up.

For example, imagine throwing a ball straight up into the air. While it's flying upward, your hands are still holding onto it because they're exerting more force (pushing) than Earth's gravity can pull. But once you let go, gravity quickly takes over and pulls the ball back down to the ground.",630,131,12.16,9.111,10.77,12.16,9.111,10.77,-0.048,9.1,16.85,"[28.6, 16.7, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 42.9, 0.0, 0.0, 16.7, 14.3, 50.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",2560.0,11490.22,12269.28,779.06,78.2

1. Universal Attraction: Every object with mass in the universe attracts every other object with a gravitational pull.

2. Distance Matters: The strength of gravity weakens as distance increases, following an inverse square law (meaning it drops off quickly over long distances).

3. Warped Space-Time: According to Einstein's theory of general relativity, massive objects like planets and stars curve the fabric of space-time around them, causing other objects to follow curved paths.

4. Not Just for Planets: Gravity affects everything from tiny particles to galaxies, though its effects can be very different at different scales.

5. Different Than Other Forces: Unlike electromagnetic forces that can push or pull in various directions, gravity always pulls things together towards each other's centers of mass.

6. Measured by Mass: The strength of gravitational force depends on the masses of both objects and the distance between them - though it's not quite as simple as just multiplying these factors together.

This isn't true - they're actually still under Earth's gravitational pull, but they're also accelerating forward at the same rate as their spacecraft (due to Newton's First Law of Motion). It looks like weightlessness because both the astronauts and their spacecraft are falling around the Earth together, creating a sensation of floating in space.

Another myth is that gravity only works on planets. In reality, gravity exists everywhere - it's what keeps the moon orbiting Earth, what pulls tides in oceans, and even affects spacecraft traveling between planets. We just don't feel it as strongly when we're standing still because we have mass but are also pulled down by all the other masses around us (including the Earth itself).",872,170,4.126,0.209,41.21,4.126,0.209,41.2,0.358,6.8,15.78,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",2560.0,12266.24,12269.6,3.36,78.1

• When an airplane moves forward, it pushes air down and backward. This creates ""lift"" which makes the plane rise into the sky.

• Lift happens because the air flows faster over the curved top of the wing compared to the bottom, creating a difference in pressure (like when you blow across the top of a piece of paper).

• Even though gravity pulls planes down, their forward motion and special design keep them from falling. It's like the plane is ""falling"" through the air but never actually hitting the ground.

• The wings are angled slightly upward to maximize this lift effect, making it even easier for the plane to stay airborne.",769,156,3.947,0.253,39.52,3.947,0.253,39.53,-0.492,5.8,16.72,"[16.7, 0.0, 0.0, 16.7, 0.0, 0.0, 16.7, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 16.7, 0.0, 33.3, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",2560.0,12257.23,12262.63,5.4,78.2

Pros:
- Produces very little greenhouse gas emissions, making it an effective tool for reducing climate change
- Has a high capacity factor (around 90%), meaning plants run almost continuously to meet demand
- Can provide reliable baseload power, helping balance the grid with renewables
- Uses fuel that's abundant in many countries, reducing import dependence

Cons:
- The nuclear waste from spent fuel is radioactive and remains hazardous for thousands of years
- Nuclear accidents (like Chernobyl or Fukushima) can have severe long-term environmental impacts
- Building new reactors is expensive and time-consuming
- There are concerns about nuclear proliferation and safety risks like meltdowns
- Public opinion often strongly opposes nuclear power due to these factors

1. First, learn about variables, data types, and basic operators.

4. Understand pointers and memory management in C++.

- ""C++ Primer"" by Stanley B. Lippman
- ""The C++ Programming Language"" by Bjarne Stroustrup
- Websites like Codecademy or W3Schools have excellent C++ tutorials

Start small with simple programs, and gradually build up to more complex ones. Practice regularly, as C++ requires consistent practice to master.
