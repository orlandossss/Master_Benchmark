> Explanation: While it's true that any two masses attract each other, this concept of ""gravity"" as we commonly understand it has more to do with how these forces behave over long distances and large scales, not just between individual masses. For instance, Earth's gravity keeps us from floating away into space.

**Pros:**
1. **High Energy Output:** Nuclear power plants generate a lot of electricity from a small amount of fuel, making it efficient in terms of energy production.
2. **Low Greenhouse Gas Emissions:** Unlike fossil fuels, nuclear energy doesn't emit carbon dioxide during operation, which helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
3. **Stable Electricity Supply:** Nuclear power plants can operate continuously, providing a stable source of electricity even when other renewable sources might be less reliable.
4. **Large Capacity:** They have the capacity to generate large amounts of energy, making them suitable for meeting high demand.

**Cons:**
1. **Radioactive Waste:** Nuclear power produces radioactive waste that must be stored safely for thousands of years, posing challenges for disposal and environmental safety.
2. **High Initial Costs:** Building a nuclear power plant is expensive, requiring significant upfront investment.
3. **Safety Concerns:** There are risks associated with accidents at the plants, such as Chernobyl and Fukushima, which can have catastrophic consequences.
4. **Nuclear Accidents:** Even with safeguards in place, there's always a risk of an accident due to human error or equipment failure.

Good luck! Starting with C++ can seem overwhelming, but it's a lot of fun. Let's break it down step by step. First, get comfortable with basic concepts like variables and data types. Then, move on to writing small programs using those concepts. As you progress, learn about control structures like loops and conditionals, which let your programs make decisions. Functions help organize your code. Once you have these basics, you can explore more advanced topics like pointers and classes. Remember, practice is key. Try solving coding challenges or work on small projects to reinforce what you've learned.
