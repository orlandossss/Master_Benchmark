For instance, Earth's gravity keeps us from floating away into space. Moreover, the idea of gravity being solely an attraction is misleading because other forces, like electromagnetism, play crucial roles in how objects move and interact in our everyday lives. So, while mass is important, the complete picture includes many factors.",
