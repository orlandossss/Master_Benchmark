Reality: While all objects accelerate equally under gravity, they don't hit the ground simultaneously when dropped from the same height because other forces like air resistance also play a role.

- However, planes are designed to work against this pull of gravity. 
- They have wings shaped like an airfoil which allows air to flow faster over the top than underneath.
- This difference in speed creates a pressure difference - lower pressure above and higher pressure below the wing.
- The higher pressure beneath pushes the plane upwards, counteracting the downward force of gravity. This upward push is called lift.
- As long as the lift generated by the wings exceeds the downward pull of gravity, the plane will stay airborne.
- So even though gravity exists, planes are built to overcome it using their aerodynamic design and engines' thrust.",708,138,2.834,0.31,48.7,2.833,0.31,48.71,-0.283,13.6,30.59,"[25.0, 42.9, 14.3, 14.3, 0.0, 14.3, 42.9, 50.0, 0.0, 0.0, 75.0, 42.9, 14.3, 14.3, 14.3, 25.0]",3201.0,13576.75,13582.63,5.88,86.5

Pros:
1. Nuclear power plants have a high capacity factor, meaning they can generate electricity consistently and reliably.
2. They produce minimal greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuel-based power generation.
3. Nuclear reactors require less space than other types of power plants to generate large amounts of electricity.

Cons: 
1. The spent nuclear fuel is highly radioactive and remains hazardous for thousands of years, posing storage and disposal challenges.
2. There's a risk of catastrophic accidents at nuclear power plants, which can lead to widespread contamination (e.g., Chernobyl, Fukushima).
3. The cost of building and decommissioning nuclear reactors can be very high compared to other energy sources.

First off, make sure you have a good text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) installed. Some popular options are Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, or even the command line using GCC/G++. This is where you'll write and run your C++ code.

Next, focus on learning the basics of the language syntax. Start with simple programs like ""Hello, World!"" to get comfortable with writing and compiling code. Then move on to variables, data types (like int, float, string), and basic input/output using cin/cout.

Once you grasp the fundamentals, dive into control structures - if statements, for loops, while loops. These let your program make decisions and repeat actions based on conditions. 

From there, explore functions! Functions help break down code into reusable blocks that perform specific tasks. Learn about function parameters, return types, and how to call them.

Next up are arrays and strings. Arrays allow you to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable. Strings are essentially arrays of characters used for text manipulation.

As you progress, tackle more complex topics like pointers (which deal with memory addresses) and object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism. These might seem challenging at first but they're incredibly powerful tools once mastered.

Don't forget to practice consistently! Write small programs, solve coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank, and gradually work your way up to larger projects.

Lastly, join online communities (like Stack Overflow, Reddit's r/cpp) or study groups. Interacting with other learners can help clarify doubts and motivate you through the learning process.

Remember, Rome wasn't built in a day - take it one step at a time, and soon enough, you'll be writing efficient C++ programs!
