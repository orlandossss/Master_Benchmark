Think of it like this:

*   **Everything we experience is affected by gravity.** You can't stand on the ground, you can't fly, you can't feel the pull of the Earth.
*   **Gravity is the force that pulls objects towards each other.** It's a fundamental force, and it's the reason why everything falls towards the ground.
*   **It's a constant, invisible force.** We don't experience it directly, but it's a constant presence that's always there.
*   **Gravity affects the speed of objects.** The faster an object moves, the more gravity it exerts. This is why we stand up and walk when we're walking.

So, to answer your question, gravity is the invisible force that pulls everything together and keeps our bodies grounded. It's a powerful and essential force shaping our world!

1.  **Understand the problem:** The function should return the average of the numbers in the list.
2.  **Find the data type:**  It should be a `double` because the numbers are integers.
3.  **Find the operators:**  It should be a `+` operator (addition) and a `*` operator (multiplication).
4.  **Find the control flow:**  It should be a `for` loop that iterates through the list and calculates the average.
5.  **Write the code:**  The code should use the `double` data type to store the numbers and the `+` operator to add them together.  The loop should be structured to be clear and easy to follow.

By following these steps, you can effectively learn C++ and start solving problems in your spare time.  Good luck!
