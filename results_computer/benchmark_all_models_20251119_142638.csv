**1. What is gravity?**  
Answer: Gravity is the force that pulls objects toward each other, like how Earth pulls you to the ground.  

**2. Why does an apple fall from a tree?**  
Answer: Because gravity pulls objects toward Earth, even small things like apples fall when they’re released.  

**3. What happens to a ball when you drop it?**  
Answer: It falls faster than a feather because gravity acts equally on both, but in reality, it falls at the same rate in a vacuum.

**Why it's false:** While gravity is the weakest of the four fundamental forces, it's the **only force that acts over long distances** (like between planets or stars). Other forces, like **electromagnetism**, **strong nuclear force**, and **weak nuclear force**, also exist but are either much stronger, act over shorter distances, or only affect certain particles. For example, electromagnetism keeps electrons in atoms, but it's stronger than gravity and acts only between charged particles.  

**Simple example:** Imagine gravity as a ""slow, gentle pull"" that keeps planets in orbit, but electromagnetism is like a ""strong, quick push"" that holds electrons in atoms. Both exist, but gravity is the only one that acts over vast distances. 🌌✨",811,440,3.516,0.192,125.15,3.516,0.192,125.13,0.489,5.3,20.51,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 100.0, 0.0, 0.0]",2560.0,12685.76,12725.66,39.91,81.2
