The common belief that gravity doesn’t exist is a myth because it’s actually a fundamental force in nature. Here's why:

1. **Gravity as a Force**: Gravity is the mutual attraction between any two bodies due to their masses. It isn’t a force acting on all objects automatically like some other myths suggest.

2. **Inertia and Inertial Mass**: Every object resists changes in its state of motion, known as inertia. This keeps things moving or at rest unless acted upon by another force. For example, an apple falls to the ground because it has inertia, not because someone is pulling it with gravity automatically.

3. **Fictitious Force in Inertial Frames**: If we're inside a car that stops suddenly, we feel pushed back forward. This is because our body (inertia) resists moving from what was previously at rest relative to the car. Similarly, objects on a chair experience inertia and remain stationary while weight (normal force) acts downward.

4. **Newton’s Third Law**: Gravity follows Newton's third law, which states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. Without gravity, space would be empty, and movement wouldn't occur as we do on Earth or in orbit around a planet.

In summary, gravity isn’t just about pulling objects down; it explains why inertia keeps things moving or at rest. This principle is foundational to understanding how planets move and interact with each other in the universe.",1466,676,4.889,0.181,138.26,4.889,0.181,138.26,0.073,15.1,21.36,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 16.7, 20.0, 0.0, 0.0, 16.7, 16.7, 71.4, 33.3, 16.7]",3201.0,13031.49,13031.91,0.43,82.3

**Pros:**

1. **Clean Energy:** Nuclear power generates clean energy with no greenhouse gas emissions when used for non-renewable fuels like coal.

2. **Conservation of Resources:** It promotes the use of finite resources, reducing waste compared to fossil fuels.

3. **Environmental Benefits:** Nuclear decommissionment generates fewer waste materials than traditional fission plants.

4. **Safety and Reliability:** The decommissioning process minimizes radioactive fallout, which is a concern for safety in some regions.

5. **Social and Community Health:**

   - It fosters a culture of sustainability and community engagement among stakeholders.
   
   - Nuclear energy can reduce reliance on fossil fuels, contributing to a greener society.

**Cons:**

1. **Climate Change Concerns:** Proponents argue that nuclear power could exacerbate climate change if not managed effectively.

2. **Fuel Waste and Waste Creation:** The process of decommissioning can lead to significant fuel waste and potential for resource depletion.

3. **Health Risks from Radioactivity:** Long-term exposure to radiation from nuclear reactions has been linked to health issues, such as cancer and radiation-associated illnesses.
