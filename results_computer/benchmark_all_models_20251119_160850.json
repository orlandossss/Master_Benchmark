It's what keeps us on the ground instead of floating away into space, and what causes planets to orbit stars.\n\nIn everyday life, we mostly experience gravity as an invisible, constant downward pull. But in space and for very large masses like black holes or neutron stars, it gets much stronger or even creates massive distortions in spacetime itself.\n\nScientists are still working on a complete theory of gravity that would explain all these behaviors and how they connect to each other. Einstein's General Relativity is the most successful framework we have so far, but there might be more to discover yet.\n",

The further away you are from Earth's center, the weaker the pull becomes until it's almost nonexistent at the edge of space where Earth ends.\n\nOr another way to visualize gravity is to imagine being on a massive bowling ball floating in space, surrounded by smaller balls (like planets). Even though each planet has its own motion and doesn't \"fall\" toward any other planet, they're all pulled equally toward the bowling ball's center. That's basically what happens with gravity between objects.\n\nThink of it this way: if you drop a ball from your hand, you can't see how it curves through space. But that curve is like Earth's invisible pull, drawing everything down.",

How can you experience weightlessness, even though gravity is still acting on you?\n\nAnswer 1: Objects are pulled toward Earth's center by gravitational force.\n\nAnswer 2: Light bends because it follows a curved path in the presence of strong gravitational fields (gravitational lensing).\n\nAnswer 3: You float in space stations and orbit the Earth, but your feet and head don't touch any surface. Gravity still holds you down, so you feel weightless from the lack of friction holding you to surfaces.\n\nFeel free to check answers with me!",
