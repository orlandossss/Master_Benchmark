Imagine you're sitting on a trampoline and someone jumps on beside you, they make the whole trampoline bounce. Gravity works the same way - everything has weight and wants to stay on the ground, even though we can't feel it.

It's what makes things fall down when you drop them, and why astronauts float in space (they're not really floating, but because there's no gravity pulling on them).",467,97,6.312,5.242,15.37,6.312,5.243,15.37,0.022,7.2,17.65,"[25.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 14.3, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",2560.0,12319.97,13224.93,904.96,84.2

It's what keeps us on the ground instead of floating away into space, and what causes planets to orbit stars.

In everyday life, we mostly experience gravity as an invisible, constant downward pull. But in space and for very large masses like black holes or neutron stars, it gets much stronger or even creates massive distortions in spacetime itself.

Scientists are still working on a complete theory of gravity that would explain all these behaviors and how they connect to each other. Einstein's General Relativity is the most successful framework we have so far, but there might be more to discover yet.

The further away you are from Earth's center, the weaker the pull becomes until it's almost nonexistent at the edge of space where Earth ends.

Or another way to visualize gravity is to imagine being on a massive bowling ball floating in space, surrounded by smaller balls (like planets). Even though each planet has its own motion and doesn't ""fall"" toward any other planet, they're all pulled equally toward the bowling ball's center. That's basically what happens with gravity between objects.

Think of it this way: if you drop a ball from your hand, you can't see how it curves through space. But that curve is like Earth's invisible pull, drawing everything down.",796,159,2.002,0.229,79.41,2.002,0.229,79.43,-0.499,8.6,19.54,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 16.7, 16.7, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",2560.0,13250.87,13266.56,15.69,84.5

2. Why does light bend around massive objects like stars?
3. How can you experience weightlessness, even though gravity is still acting on you?

Answer 1: Objects are pulled toward Earth's center by gravitational force.

Answer 2: Light bends because it follows a curved path in the presence of strong gravitational fields (gravitational lensing).

Answer 3: You float in space stations and orbit the Earth, but your feet and head don't touch any surface. Gravity still holds you down, so you feel weightless from the lack of friction holding you to surfaces.

• Lift is generated when air flows over curved surfaces, like wings.

• This movement of air creates pressure differences that push the plane upward.

• Gravity pulls everything downward, but the plane's upward force (lift) counters this pull.

• The faster and smoother the airflow moves over the wings, the more lift is created.

• More lift means less gravity pulling down, allowing the plane to stay airborne.

• Thrust from jet engines helps keep the plane moving forward so it can generate more lift.",551,111,1.49,0.189,74.49,1.49,0.189,74.49,-0.025,8.5,19.15,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",3201.0,13217.57,13225.44,7.87,84.3
