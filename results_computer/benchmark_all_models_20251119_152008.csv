1. **What is gravity?**  
   - A force that pulls objects toward each other.  
   - A type of light energy that travels through space.  

2. **Why does the moon have less gravity than Earth?**  
   - Because it’s smaller and lighter.  
   - Because it’s farther from Earth and has less mass.  

3. **Why do objects fall toward the ground?**  
   - Because gravity pulls them down.  
   - Because they’re too heavy to be affected by air resistance.
