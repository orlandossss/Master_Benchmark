A **medium-sized jacket** might work for most people, but you can always check the size chart or try on a jacket to see how it fits. Also, layering (like a sweater over a jacket) can help keep you warm. So, a jacket is a good idea, but the exact size will depend on you! 🌡️",

This is false because gravity isn’t a force in the traditional sense—it’s a **field** that exists everywhere in the universe. This field causes objects with mass to attract each other, but it’s not a \"force\" in the way people think. For example, the Earth’s gravity pulls you toward its center, but it’s not a force that’s \"pushing\" you—it’s a natural effect of the field. The myth might also stem from the idea that gravity only acts between objects, but in reality, it affects everything, even tiny atoms.

      "response": "Start by learning the basics of C++! Here's a simple plan:  \n1. **Learn the fundamentals**:  \n   - Variables, data types (int, float, char, etc.), and operators.  \n   - Control structures (if/else, loops).  \n   - Functions and basic syntax.  \n\n2. **Practice with examples**:  \n   - Write simple programs, like a calculator or a \"Hello, World!\" program.  \n   - Use online platforms like **LeetCode**, **GeeksforGeeks**, or **Codewars** for exercises.  \n\n3. **Use a beginner-friendly resource**:  \n   - Books like *C++ How to Program* by Deitel & Turner or free tutorials on **YouTube** (search \"C++ beginner tutorials\").  \n\n4. **Build projects**:  \n   - Start with small projects, like a to-do list or a simple game.  \n\n5. **Debug and learn**:  \n   - Use a debugger (like GDB) or online tools to spot errors.  \n\n**Tip**: Focus on understanding concepts first, then move to more complex topics. Patience and practice will help! 🚀",
