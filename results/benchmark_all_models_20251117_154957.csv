Here’s the key: **every object with mass pulls on every other object**. The stronger the pull, the more massive the objects are. That’s why heavy things like rocks fall faster than light things like balloons—because they’re more massive.  

Gravity also explains why the Moon stays in orbit around Earth and why stars don’t just float away. It’s one of the four fundamental forces in the universe, and it’s what keeps everything in place, even in space.

1. **High Efficiency**: Produces a lot of energy from a small amount of fuel (like uranium).  
2. **Reliable Power**: Provides a steady, base-load supply of electricity, even during peak demand.  
3. **Low Greenhouse Gas Emissions**: Doesn’t release carbon dioxide or other harmful gases during operation.  
4. **Cost-Effective for Some**: Can be cheaper than renewable sources like solar or wind, especially with advanced technology.  

**Cons of Nuclear Energy:**  
1. **Risk of Accidents**: High-stakes disasters (e.g., Chernobyl, Fukushima) can cause massive environmental and health damage.  
2. **Radioactive Waste**: Byproducts are radioactive and require safe, long-term storage, which is still a challenge.  
3. **High Costs**: Building plants is expensive, and maintenance is costly.  
4. **Limited Renewable Potential**: It’s not a renewable resource (uranium is finite) and depends on uranium mining, which can harm ecosystems.
