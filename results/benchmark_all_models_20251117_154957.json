      "response": "Gravity is the force that pulls objects toward each other, like how apples fall from trees or why you feel pulled to the ground when you're sitting on a chair. It’s the reason why planets orbit the sun and why your phone stays on the table even when you move. Think of it as a \"pull\" that’s everywhere, but we can’t see it directly.  \n\nHere’s the key: **every object with mass pulls on every other object**. The stronger the pull, the more massive the objects are. That’s why heavy things like rocks fall faster than light things like balloons—because they’re more massive.  \n\nGravity also explains why the Moon stays in orbit around Earth and why stars don’t just float away. It’s one of the four fundamental forces in the universe, and it’s what keeps everything in place, even in space.  \n\nWant to know more about how it’s measured or how it affects things like space travel?

      "response": "- **Wings create lift**: Air moves faster over the top of the wing, reducing pressure there, while the bottom of the wing has higher pressure. This pressure difference pushes the plane upward.  \n- **Thrust overcomes drag**: Engines provide forward thrust to counteract drag (the force opposing motion), allowing the plane to move through the air.  \n- **Lift balances gravity**: The upward lift force equals the plane's weight, keeping it from falling.  \n- **Speed and angle matter**: Faster speeds and a steeper angle of attack (like when taking off) increase lift, helping the plane stay airborne.",
