Think of it like this:

* **Everything has gravity.**  It's like a giant, invisible rope that pulls things towards it.
* **The bigger something is, the stronger its gravity.**  That's why mountains are taller and heavier, and planets are much bigger than you.
* **The Earth is like a giant magnet, pulling everything towards it.**  This is why the moon orbits the Earth.

So, gravity is the invisible force that keeps us on the ground and keeps the planets orbiting around the Sun.

On Earth, it explains phenomena like objects falling to the ground and keeping us grounded on high cliffs. Gravity also determines how planets are pulled toward their centers due to their mass.

Without gravity, we wouldn't feel anything except perhaps if something was pushing or pulling us up or down. Every object has weight, which is the gravitational force exerted on it by its mass. Objects like clouds and raindrops are pulled towards Earth's center, but they remain lifted off the ground because of other forces balancing gravity.

Gravity affects various phenomena beyond Earth, such as tides caused by gravitational interactions with nearby celestial bodies. Without gravity, we wouldn't have tides or natural cycles in planetary orbits. Additionally, gravity influences how objects move through space and maintains their circular paths when launched into orbit, requiring centripetal force for orbital motion without gravity.

Gravity is the feeling of pull that keeps us on Earth, though its nature might differ from what we experience when thinking about abstract forces like light bending or time dilation in relativity.

1. **Gravity's Role**: Without any thrust or engine power, gravity alone would cause the plane to float.

3. **Engine Contribution**: Planes use engines to push air downward on their wings, creating a speed difference.

4. **Pressure Difference**: The faster-moving air (below the wing) has lower pressure, while slower-moving air above (higher pressure). This creates an upward force known as lift.
