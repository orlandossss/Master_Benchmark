Here's why:

1. **Newton's Laws**: The correct explanation is based on **Newton's laws of motion** and **universal gravitation**. According to these laws, all objects with mass attract each other with a force proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This means that, in a vacuum, a feather would still fall at the same rate as a stone due to air resistance, not because gravity is ""pulling it down.""

2. **The Myth's Flaw**: The myth of the ""falling apple"" (which actually refers to Newton's experiment in 1687) is a **story**, not a scientific explanation. It highlights the **human misconception** that gravity is a force acting on objects, not just a physical property. However, this is a **historical misconception**, not a false myth.

2025-11-17T12:12:27.863867,qwen3:0.6b,"0,6B",matevz,What are the pros and cons of nuclear energy ?,"**Pros of Nuclear Energy:**

1. **High Energy Output**: Nuclear plants can produce vast amounts of energy per unit of fuel (uranium) compared to fossil fuel plants.
2. **Clean Energy**: Nuclear power does not produce greenhouse gases, making it a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels.
3. **Low Carbon Footprint**: Nuclear energy emits little CO₂, reducing reliance on fossil fuels.
4. **Limited Resource**: Uranium is a finite and non-renewable resource, which makes nuclear energy a sustainable option for the long term.
5. **Low Accident Risk**: Nuclear plants are designed with safety measures to minimize risks of accidents, though they are not completely safe.

**Cons of Nuclear Energy:**

1. **Radioactive Waste Management**: Nuclear plants generate radioactive waste that requires extensive and costly disposal.
2. **Accident Risk**: Nuclear plants are vulnerable to accidents (e.g., Chernoba or Fukushima) due to human error or design flaws.
3. **Environmental Impact**: Nuclear power can release radioactive isotopes, which may contaminate the environment and pose health risks.
4. **Short-Term Fuel Supply**: Uranium is a finite resource, which creates a dependency on it, limiting long-term sustainability.
