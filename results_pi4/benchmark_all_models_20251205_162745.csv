1. **Why does gravity pull objects toward Earth?**
   Gravity pulls all objects towards Earth due to its mass attracting other masses in space, governed by Newton's law of universal gravitation.

2. **How does gravity explain falling on Mars vs. Earth?**
   On Mars, which has a greater mass than Earth, the gravitational force pulls heavier objects faster, causing them to fall more quickly near the sun.

3. **Why don't books stay on tables?**
   Books are heavier than tables (equalizing their masses) and experience stronger gravitational pull, falling faster toward the floor than they can move on the table.

Each answer ties back to gravity's role in pulling objects towards Earth, considering mass, distance, and acceleration.",761,631,203.804,2.354,3.1,1.0,99.03,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",1800.0,1828.24,1833.65,5.41,23.2,83.2,throttled=0xe0008,0.889,2.977,2.645,539.055,1.1706,0,13,0,69632,0,20,13,69632,0.06,0.0,0,1.54

- **Gravity** pulls everything down to Earth's surface, but it doesn’t allow a plane to move upward.

- **Lift** is the upward force needed for flight. It’s created by airflow over the airplane's wing due to Bernoulli's principle, resulting in lower pressure on top and higher below, creating a vacuum that pushes the plane up.

- **Thrust** provides forward force, often from engines, pushing the plane upwards against gravity.

Without lift or thrust, gravity keeps planes grounded. Lift enables them to overcome gravity, moving upward with thrust for flight.",610,437,145.679,3.046,3.0,0.5,98.79,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",1800.0,1835.31,1842.03,6.71,23.3,82.7,throttled=0xe0008,0.883,2.971,2.622,381.958,1.1441,0,10,0,53248,0,16,10,53248,0.07,0.0,0,1.6
