The stronger the mass, the stronger the gravitational pull - which explains why Earth pulls on you much more than the Moon does.

One fascinating aspect is Einstein's theory of general relativity, which shows that gravity isn't actually a ""force"" in the traditional sense, but rather the curvature of spacetime caused by massive objects. Imagine placing a heavy bowling ball on a trampoline - it creates a dip that smaller balls naturally roll toward. That's similar to how planets create curves in spacetime.

The speed of gravity is interesting too - while light moves at 299,792 km/s, gravitational waves (ripples in spacetime) can travel even faster, though they're still incredibly slow by everyday standards.

This is actually a misconception - the weight difference between Earth and the Moon has nothing to do with the surface composition. The reason objects weigh less on the Moon (about 1/6th their Earth weight) is due solely to the Moon's weaker gravitational pull compared to Earth's. If you placed an object on the Moon, it would still fall towards the center at the same rate as if it were on a solid surface - the difference in weight comes from being farther from Earth's mass and thus experiencing less gravitational force.",645,131,199.184,12.839,0.66,1.0,99.63,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 10.0]",1800.0,5828.87,5830.56,1.7,74.4,82.3,throttled=0xe0008,0.89,2.991,2.662,530.211,0.2471,0,11,0,61440,0,29,11,61440,0.06,0.0,0,2.64

• Airplanes are designed to move really fast through the air (like over 500 mph)

• When they go that fast, the air moving past their wings creates an invisible upward force called ""lift""

• The shape of the wing is specially curved - it's thicker on top and thinner underneath

• This shape makes the air going over the top of the wing move faster than the air going under

• Because air moves faster on top, it creates a lower pressure area above the wing compared to below

• The difference in air pressure between the top and bottom of the wing pushes the plane up into the sky

• At the same time, the wings are angled slightly upward so they're pushing down against gravity - but not enough to overcome lift's upward force

So basically, a plane stays up by using its speed to create an upward push from the air around it!",872,186,287.774,15.504,0.65,0.0,99.65,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",1800.0,5817.91,5834.2,16.28,74.4,82.3,throttled=0xe0008,0.879,2.992,2.63,756.763,0.2458,0,16,0,86016,0,47,16,86016,0.06,0.0,0,2.94

Pros:
- Reliable base load power generation with minimal carbon emissions, making it a potential solution to climate change
- High energy output from a relatively small amount of fuel (uranium)
- Low operating costs once plants are built
- Nuclear power provides approximately 10% of global electricity

Cons:
- High initial construction costs and long build times
- Risk of nuclear accidents (like Chernobyl and Fukushima), though modern safety systems have greatly reduced this risk
- Challenges with radioactive waste disposal and storage
- Public perception issues due to fear of radiation and past accidents
- Uranium mining can have environmental impacts

   - ""C++ Primer"" by Stanley Lippman
   - Online platforms like Codecademy or Coursera
   - Practice with simple programs first

4. Once you're comfortable with basics, learn about:
   - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts
   - Classes and objects
